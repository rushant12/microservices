we are trying to develop java application .......... whilch will be deployed on AKS, 
Application needs access to azure key vault to perform blob storage access
Azure key valult is not accessable from outside AKS 
My Dev machine(vdi-name) does not have rights to access azure key valult and same can not be provided as per security team.
Access only given to AKS or DEV servers on Request.

Actions needed to perform 

Hi @Rafi, do we have any java application machine or servers to test our application before deploying on AKS.

Azure key vault permissions to be discussed with wayne once dev machine acces is resolved.
