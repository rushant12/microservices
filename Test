I am currently working on resolving the dependency issues for the project, and I have managed to fix those. However, I am facing an issue with DNS resolution for the URL https://nsn-dev-ecm-kva-001.vault.azure.net. I am getting the error "Could not resolve host," which seems to be related to network connectivity or DNS settings.

Since this issue seems to be beyond my current configuration, I kindly request your assistance in checking if there are any DNS or network configurations on your end that might be affecting the connection to the Key Vault URL.

I would greatly appreciate any guidance or support you can provide in fixing this issue. Please let me know if there are any specific details you require from my side.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
