Subject: Request for Azure Blob Storage and Key Vault Access Details
 
I am currently working on a File Manger project that requires access to Azure Blob Storage and the Azure Key Vault. To proceed, I would like to request the following details to ensure that I can set up the necessary connections and retrieve the required data securely:
 
1. Azure Blob Storage:
Storage Account Name: To connect to the Blob Storage.
 
Container Name: The specific container within the storage account that I will be interacting with.
 
Azure Active Directory (AAD) Credentials: For authentication via Service Principal, please provide:
 
Client ID (Application ID)
 
Client Secret
 
Tenant ID
 
2. Azure Key Vault (If applicable):
Key Vault URL: The endpoint to access the Key Vault.
 
Secret Name: The names of any secrets I need to retrieve (e.g., storage keys, account keys, or other sensitive information).
 
Access Permissions: Ensure the appropriate permissions are granted to the service principal to access the secrets.
 
Additionally, if you have any recommended access policies or configurations that should be in place, kindly share that information as well.
 
We are also planning to deploy the application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), so it would be helpful if the necessary configurations and permissions are aligned with the AKS deployment.
 
Once I have the above details, I will be able to configure the necessary connections securely and begin working with the Azure services.
 
Thank you for your support and assistance. I look forward to your response. Please let me know if you need any further information from my side.
