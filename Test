Subject: Blob Storage Access from Local – Not Feasible via PVC

Hi [Manager's Name],

Just a quick update — it's not possible to store files in Azure Blob Storage from a local machine using the Kubernetes PVC (azureblob-fuse-premium), as PVCs are only accessible inside the cluster.

For local file uploads, we can use the Azure Blob Storage SDK instead.
Steps include:

Add the Azure Blob SDK to the project.

Use the storage account connection string.

Upload files directly via the SDK.

Let me know if you’d like help setting this up.

Best,
[Your Name]
