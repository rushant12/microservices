We understand that Philips provides the following service to create secrets in HashiCorp Vault:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl --location --request POST 'https://vault-public-vault-75e984b5.bdecd756.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200/v1/Store_Dev/10099' \
--header 'x-vault-namespace: admin/espire' \
--header 'x-vault-token: <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "test": "test"
}'
To connect to Azure Blob Storage, we require the following details:

accountName

accountKey

containerName

Currently, we do not have all the required details. Could you please help us by either:

Creating the required secrets on our behalf, or

Sharing the necessary details so we can create the secrets ourselves?

Your assistance is much appreciated.
