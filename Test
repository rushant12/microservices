Hi @Van Vuuren, L. (Lizelle),

Yesterday, the required dependencies were not available on Nexus. However, today I was able to download them successfully after updating the certification in my local JDK.

That said, I'm now encountering an issue caused by an incompatible version of azure-identity with azure-core. I'm currently investigating this.

Hi @Rimer, R. (Raphael),

Could you please assist in uploading higher versions (or all available versions) of the following dependencies to Nexus?

azure-core â€“ Currently defaulting to version 1.12.0

Expected compatible versions:

azure-identity: 1.5.1 or higher

azure-security-keyvault-secrets: 4.1.2

This would help us avoid the current runtime issue, shown below:
