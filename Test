File Manager application will be attempting to connect when deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), here is a detailed overview:

Kafka Cluster (Bootstrap Servers):

The File Manager application will connect to the Kafka cluster to consume messages from the specified Kafka topic(s). It will utilize the bootstrap servers for initial connection to the Kafka brokers.

Azure Storage (Blob Storage or File Storage):

The application will also need to connect to Azure Storage (either Blob Storage or File Storage) to store processed files. This will require the proper access credentials to authenticate and perform operations within the Azure Storage service.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

The application will be deployed to AKS, and as part of this deployment, it will interact with Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, and containerized environments within the AKS cluster.

External Services/Applications (if applicable):

If there are additional services integrated with the File Manager, such as microservices or external APIs, the application would also attempt to connect to those services during its operation.

In summary, at the moment of deployment to AKS, the File Manager will primarily be connecting to:

The Kafka cluster for consuming messages from the relevant topics.

Azure Storage to store the processed files.

Please ensure that the necessary credentials for both Kafka and Azure Storage are securely provided to the application, potentially through environment variables, Kubernetes Secrets, or other secure mechanisms.
