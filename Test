We are currently in the process of developing a Java application that will:

Consume files from Kafka

Process those files

Store the output in Azure Blob Storage

To securely perform Blob Storage operations, the application requires access to Azure Key Vault for retrieving the necessary secrets.

However, we are currently facing the following constraints:

Azure Key Vault is not accessible from outside the AKS environment

Our development virtual machine (V105P11PRA0888) does not have the required permissions to access the Key Vault

As per the security team’s policy, access to the Key Vault cannot be granted to individual development environments

Access is strictly limited to the AKS cluster or designated, pre-approved DEV servers

Actions Required
@Rafi – Could you please confirm if we have any existing Java application server or DEV environment (with Key Vault access) available for testing the application prior to deployment on AKS?

Azure Key Vault permissions – To be further discussed with Wayne, once a suitable test environment is identified
