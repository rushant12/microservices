End-to-End Integration Flow: Kafka → HashiCorp Vault → Azure Blob Storage → Kafka
 
1.Kafka Consumer Setup- Completed
 
  Configure Kafka consumer properties (bootstrap servers, group ID, deserializer, etc.)- Completed
 
  Subscribe to the relevant Kafka topic- Completed
 
  Implement message listener/consumer logic- Completed
 
2.Process Kafka Message- Pending
 
  Parse incoming Kafka message to extract file identifiers, metadata, or request details
 
  Validate message format and handle invalid/malformed messages
 
  Log or trace message receipt for observability
 
3.Fetch Secrets from HashiCorp Vault- Pending
 
  Authenticate with Vault (token-based)
 
  Make secure API call to fetch secrets (accountName, accountKey, containerName)
 
  Handle and cache secrets securely (avoid logging sensitive info)
 
  Retry or fail gracefully if secrets are unavailable
 
4.Connect to Azure Blob Storage- Pending
 
Initialize BlobServiceClient using fetched credentials
 
Ensure container exists or create if necessary
 
Authenticate and prepare for blob operations
 
5.Store Files in Blob Storage-Pending
 
Retrieve or generate list of files to store based on Kafka message
 
Upload files to the appropriate blob container
 
Track and log upload status (success/failure)
 
Handle large files or chunked uploads if required
 
6.Prepare Summary File- Pending
 
  Generate a summary report (e.g., JSON) of uploaded files
 
Include metadata like file names, upload status, timestamps, etc.
 
Save summary to local temp storage or directly to blob
 
7.Send Summary File to Kafka Producer - Pending
 
 Read or load the summary file
 
 Prepare message payload with summary content
 
 Produce and send message to target Kafka topic
 
 Log Kafka producer status and handle retries if needed
 
8.Error Handling and Logging-Partially Completed
 
  Implement structured logging and error tracking
 
  Handle network failures, secrets fetch failures, blob upload errors, etc.
 
9.Configuration and Deployment-Pending
 
  Externalize configuration (Kafka, Vault, Blob) via properties or environment variables
 
  Containerize the app (e.g., using Docker)
 
  Deploy to the target environment (e.g., cloud platform, Kubernetes)
