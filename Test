Could you please share the Azure Key Vault URL (Ex: https://myvault.vault.azure.net/) with us? We need it to fetch secrets like storage account info for our application.

We’re planning to use DefaultAzureCredential for authentication, which will use the System-Assigned Managed Identity by default.

Also, we’re currently unable to download the required Azure SDK JARs (e.g., azure-identity and azure-security-keyvault-secrets) from Nexus due to a trust anchor issue:

java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty
Please advise if there's a workaround or if we can fetch dependencies directly from Maven Central.
