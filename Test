I’m not aware of an environment where you can test / build against Azure vault, however we do use an instance of a vault (Hashicorp) which is accessible to retrieve and inserts secrets. I’m not sure how different the Azure vault and Hashicorp are (I think they are not really that different) but you could use an instance of the vault to test your code and then switch over to vault when your code is correctly deployed?
